# LÖVE VN ENGINE

 Simple LÖVE vn for on the 3DS, iOS, pc (and hopefully more in the future).

# Installing

To install put LOVEpotion.3dsx into the "/3ds/LovePotion" folder on the sd card of the 3DS (if the LovePotion folder doesn't exist create it) and copy the "game" folder in there.

# Running

To run the vn simply startup LovePotion from the homebrew launcher.

# Creating custom story

To make your own story copy the "EmptyGame" and rename it to "game" and copy over main.lua from the original "game" folder.

If you want to add a new image just add ""(imagename.extention) (LineNumber) "," to image.lua. (the ds needs .t3x files for textures)

In the script.lua file if you want to add a question type " qqq " after it and then after that exactly put the text it should go to if the awnser is no. If you want to move from one chuck of text to another type " ggg " followed by the exact text from the line you want it to move to. if you type "123quit123" anywhere in a line the program will exit *without* showing that line.

# Future plans

- Add custom questions.

- Optimize the " qqq " and " ggg " (maybe be giving exact line number as option).

- Make it easier to create t3x files.

- Automate conversion from renpy to this.

# Building

Building is currently not possible, I haven't gotten it to compile porperly yet.
